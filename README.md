Welcome to my magical `nvim` setup! 🧙‍♂️✨

## Setup

This module is now embedded into my [dotfiles](https://github.com/klepp0/dotfiles). You can use the installation process in there to setup your `nvim` configs. 🪬

### Telescope 🔭

To unlock the full potential of Telescope and see the stars (or just find your files), you’ll need these mystical artifacts:

- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep): The legendary search tool forged in the fires of Mount Code.
- [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd): The swift and nimble finder, blessed by the gods of efficiency.

Install these, and you'll be navigating your code like a wizard in no time!
